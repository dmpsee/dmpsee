# DMPsee

DMP Sent Events (DMPsee) is an **open standard** designed to propagate updates 
from DMP platforms to other systems. 
At its core, the standard defines the publication of DMP related events.
These events can then be consumed by any interested subscriber.  

This publish/subscribe model enables a loosely coupled and scalable approach 
to keeping dependent systems informed of DMP changes across platforms.  

As an open standard, DMPsee promotes interoperability, avoids vendor lock-in, 
and ensures that diverse systems can seamlessly exchange research planning updates.
